## "Murder" is a gamemode of deception and murder, based off of Murder in the Dark.
One person is a murderer with a knife, who is trying to secretly kill off the other players.
The other players must use their wits to find out who it is and kill them first.
Unfortunately they only have the one gun between them at the round start.

:warning: Basically this gamemode was made in 12 hours for the challenge to make a functional gamemode in less than a day.
Even if it has been a bit polished since then, some parts of the code can surely be improved. PRs are welcome :slight_smile:

### :package: Installation
Drag and drop the gamemode folder on your server, in /Server/Packages/
Put `game_mode = "murder"` in the config part of */Server/Config.toml*

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
Edit the gamemode to your liking by going to *murder/Shared/config/main.lua*, each line is commented so you'll know what you're editing
To add new loot types go in  *murder/Shared/config/loot.lua*, you can use an existing loot as an example

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Tool
In game, admins can press F1 (by default) to toggle the admin mode
They can place characters spawns and loot spawns on the map the server is running
To switch from a sub-mode to another (character spawn/loot spawn), use the "Reload" key
